Really love their services. Delivery is always on time. PLUS their food is always store in insulated thermal lunchbox to ensure food is always served hot!
Both lunch and dinner always comes with 2 dishes, 1 rice, a soup & a flask of red dates tea. Their food even includes fish, scallops & even soups that helps postpartum mummies to recover!`,
